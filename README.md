# fullstack-webcourse
Repository where I will be uploading the assignments for https://fullstackopen.com/ to submit and get them graded.

It will be structured as:
- Part x
    - Exercise x
    - Exercise y

- Part y
    - Exercise x
    - Exercise y

If any external references have been used for that assignment (using some code from a site like StackOverflow for example) they will be added to a file called References.md inside the root folder of said exercise. For example, references for exercise 3 from part 4 would be located in ./Part 4/Exercise 3/References.md I amn not yet sure how I will go pointing out where in the code I used said reference. tentatively will be by adding an unique marker codeword to the references list, then using said marker inside the code as a comment in lines where that reference was used.
